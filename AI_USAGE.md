ðŸ¤– AI Usage Summary

This Expense Tracker app was developed with assistance from AI (ChatGPT) to speed up design and implementation. AI support was used for:

Generating initial scaffolding with Clean MVVM architecture, Hilt DI, and Room database setup.

Implementing Jetpack Compose UI screens, navigation graph, and reusable components.

Adding and refactoring charting features (Vico â†’ MPAndroidChart) to remove dummy values.

Improving UX features such as dropdown alignment.

Creating documentation (README, comments, usage summary).

All generated content was reviewed, refined, and tested manually before being integrated into the final project.
